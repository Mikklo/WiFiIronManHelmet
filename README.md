# WiFiIronManHelmet
 For using ESP-01S to setup a web server for controlling 3D Printed helmet.

To expand on the awesome project by [Boxandloop](https://www.thingiverse.com/boxandloop/designs) I found on [thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:5137286).

Will probably build a remote controller using another ESP-01S that connects to the AP here and control with actual buttons.

Will require a small rewrite of the original arduino file.
>TODO

Wire *future arduino eye pin* to GPIO0 and *future arduino mask pin* to GPIO2.
